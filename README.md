[Stripe][stripe_home] is a payment platform that handles credit cards, bitcoin and ACH transfers. They have become one of the best platforms for handling payments for projects, services or products.

## Getting Started
In your `Package.swift` file, add a Package

For Swift 4
~~~~swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/vapor-community/stripe-provider.git", .branch("beta"))
~~~~

Register the config and the provider to your Application
~~~~swift
let config = StripeConfig(apiKey: "sk_12345678")

services.register(config)

try services.register(StripeProvider())

app = try Application(services: services)

stripeClient = try app.make(StripeClient.self)
~~~~

And you are all set. Interacting with the API is quite easy and adopts the `Future` syntax used in Vapor 3.
Making calls to the api is straight forward.
~~~~swift
let cardParams = ["exp_month": 1,
                  "exp_year": 2030,
                  "number": "4242424242424242",
                  "cvc": 123,
                  "object": "card"]

let futureCharge = try stripeClient.charge.create(amount: 2500, currency: .usd, source: cardParams)

futureCharge.do({ (charge) in
    // do something with charge object...
}).catch({ (error) in
    print(error)
})
~~~~

And you can always check the documentation to see the required paramaters for specific API calls.
