### StripeKit is a Swift package used to communicate with the [Stripe](https://stripe.com) API for Server Side Swift Apps.

## Version Support
Version **1.0.0** of this library supports the Stripe API version of **[2019-03-14](https://stripe.com/docs/upgrades#2019-03-14)**. 
You can check the releases page to use a version of this package that supports a version of the Stripe API you require.

## Installation
To start using StripeKit, in your `Package.swift`, add the following

~~~~swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/vapor-community/stripekit.git", from: "1.0.0")
~~~~

## Using the API
Initialize the `StripeClient`

~~~~swift
let elg = MultiThreadedEventLoopGroup(numberOfThreads: System.coreCount)
let stripe = StripeClient(eventLoop: elg, apiKey: "sk_12345")
~~~~

And now you have acess to the APIs via `stripe`.

The APIs you have available corrospond to what's implemented.

For example to use the `charges` API, the stripeclient has a property to access that API via routes.

~~~~swift
try stripe.charge.create(amount: 2500,
                         currency: .usd,
                         description: "A server written in swift.",
                         source: "tok_visa").flatMap { (charge) -> EventLoopFuture<Void> in
                           if charge.status == .succeeded {
                               print("New servers are on the way ðŸš€")
                           } else {
                               print("Sorry you have to use Node.js ðŸ¤¢")
                           }
            }
~~~~

## Nuances with parameters and type safety
Stripe has a habit of changing APIs and having dynamic paramters for alot of their APIs.
To accomadate for these changes, certain routes that take arguments that are `hash`s or `Dictionaries`, are represented by a swift dictionary `[String: Any]`.

For example consider the connect account api. 

~~~~swift
// We define a custom dictionary to represent the paramaters stripe requires.
// This allows 
let individual: [String: Any] = ["address": ["city": "New York",
					     "country": "US",
                                             "line1": "1551 Broadway",
                                             "postal_code": "10036",
	                  	             "state": "NY"],
				 "first_name": "Taylor",
			         "last_name": "Swift",
                                 "ssn_last_4": "0000",
				 "dob": ["day": "13",
					 "month": "12",
					 "year": "1989"]]
												 
let businessSettings: [String: Any] = ["payouts": ["statement_descriptor": "SWIFTFORALL"]]

let tosDictionary: [String: Any] = ["date": Int(Date().timeIntervalSince1970), "ip": "127.0.0.1"]

try stripe.connectAccount.create(type: .custom,										
                                 country: "US",
				 email: "a@example.com,
				 businessType: .individual,
			         defaultCurrency: .usd,
				 externalAccount: "bank_token",
			         individual: individual,
				 requestedCapabilities: ["platform_payments"],
				 settings: businessSettings,
				 tosAcceptance: tosDictionary).flatMap { connectAccount in
					print("New Stripe Connect account ID: \(connectAccount.id)")			
				}
